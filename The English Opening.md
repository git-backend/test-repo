The English Opening
===================

This is basically a revered Sicilian defence with extra tempo. It can also lead to crazy transpositions. Usually in the English from my experience with it, its nothing different than the Sicilian defence except an extra tempo and more ideas to do with it. Still, a great opening and may this live on.
