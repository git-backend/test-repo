The Kings Indian Defence
========================

This has got to be one of my favorite repertories against d4 as black. This is one of the most oldest openings in history. The origin seems unknown but not its play! This hyper modern opening shows everything about hyper modern play. Its the best example of the hyper modern play.Interesting style of the bishop and developed knight and castled king. One of the best chess openings in history.
