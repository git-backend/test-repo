The Queens Gambit
=================

This opening is no doubt one of the most common openings in d4 d5 games. White sacrifices a pawn for rapid development and usually gets his pawn back! This opening has a very old history going back to 1490 (probably even older) and its mentioned in a very old script called Gottingen manuscript. One of the oldest chess scripts of all.
