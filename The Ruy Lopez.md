The Ruy Lopez
=============

Perhaps the greatest most complex openings out there. I respect this opening as it was proven that if white plays the lines correctly, he will carry a small advantage. Its also a great opening since it explains develop and castle early and build a attack. This opening was invented sometime in the 1400 by someone who had a name called Ruy lopez.
