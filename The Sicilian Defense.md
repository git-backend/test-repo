The Sicilian Defense
====================

One of the most highly used complex and annoying defenses you will ever find. Almost every player of all rankings use this. This opening is highly successful for black and to think that this opening was once considered bad! This opening was discovered and analyzed in 1604 extending to the early 1800s. People realized this opening went to bad to dubious to ok to good to great! Even though I hate running into this defense MAY THE THIS DEFENSE LIVE ON IN THE HISTORY OF CHESS!!
