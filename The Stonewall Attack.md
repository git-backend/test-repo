The Stonewall Attack
====================

This is my favorite opening of all time. In fact without this opening, I probably wouldnt have gotten to 2000s with this. I have studied this opening for almost a year now with people and the greatest chess software out there. It is a great opening and sadly isnt as wide spread like it once was. No repertoires have been discovered so far to I guess you can say consider this opening bad when in fact world champions have played it before and some still do.
